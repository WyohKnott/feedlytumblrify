#Feedly Tumblrify

This browser extension allows you to like and reblog Tumblr posts directly
from Feedly.

##How to use

Since it's not possible to distribute private keys with browser extensions you must
first [register an application with Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/register). Fill in the form like this:

 * Application Name: FeedlyTumblrify
 * Application description: Like and reblog from Tumblr
 * Administrative contact email: your email
 * Default callback URL: https://wwww/tumblr.com/dashboard

You will be given two keys:

 * an OAuth Consumer Key
 * an OAuth Consumer Secret

Your keys are then available at this address: https://www.tumblr.com/settings/apps
